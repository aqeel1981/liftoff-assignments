For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project will be an online C-store log, where a user can select a single store from a number of C-Stores located near him or her. Each store would have different departments to chose from like sodas, snacks, candies, spirits and beer. Each department would have a drop down list categorized by companies. For example, soda department would have Coke, Seven Up and Pepsi list and the user would be able to select a company and see a list of soda products made by that company. User can do same thing with other departments and add all the selected items in a cart. After checkout, the user would have an option of either pick up the order inside the store or have it delivered to his or her vehicle.

My family owned a small C-store business and due to recent outbreak of COVID-19, we are getting lot of feedback from our customers of online ordering and delivery to vehicle in the lot.
